newly changed does the "git fetch" alone enough
no Currently i Found out the "git fetch" JUST Download the changes 
BUT does not Merge or Intall the changes into the Local Repo 
So we need USE "git merge"


NOTE:
"git pull repo_name"
This is a Combination of "git fetch" & "git merge" combined 
So the Changes Immediatley Reflects on Our Project
